# 2. Common packages to be installed with Homebrew on BOTH macOS and Linux.
#    This is your primary list for cross-platform tools. Add new tools here!
COMMON_BREW_PACKAGES=(
  bat        # A cat(1) clone with wings

  rename     # Perl-powered file renaming utility
  shellcheck # Static analysis tool for shell scripts
  shfmt      # Shell formatter
  stow       # Symlink farm manager
  thefuck    # Corrects your previous console command
  tree       # Display directories as trees
